	<h1> My Favorite Place</h1>
	<h2> Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona </h2>
  
    <p> I visited the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona and immediately it became my favorite place that I visited. I visited it during the holiday break in December 2014 with my friends. When we entered the Grand Canyon National Park, we were amazed by its overwhelming beauty. Here is a photo that I took at Grand Canyon. </p>
